Note taker

For this note take we used Node.js and Express to make a two page application. The main langueges were Javascript, html and css. In this application a user can fill in the title and text boxes and then save them. They will show up on the side of the page. The contents is stored in a db.json file. I struggled getting everything to work. I would fix one thing and something else would break.

Examples of the site.
